            <h3>How to tell if Japanese Green Tea is good quality or not!</h3>
            <p>The first clear point of distinction is in the appearance of the dry leaf. The general look of the leaf is a quality marker useful to assess quality. However, the way a tea leaf looks can be very tricky. Many people are fooled by deceptively packaged green tea that has been groomed to look beautiful.
